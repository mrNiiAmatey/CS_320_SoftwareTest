In ensuring that my code, program, or software is functional and secure in this scenario I used numerous testing techniques such as equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision testing, and coverage as well as statement testing and coverage. Furthermore, I interpret user needs by carefully detailing all the functional and non-functional requirements associated with the user needs. The functional requirements can be incorporated into the program when it is well defined and detailed by use cases and interviews. 
Finally, I approach designing software by using certain Agile principles such as initially understanding and documenting the requirements for software, designing and writing code in smaller bits, early testing, code reviews, as well as pair programming.
